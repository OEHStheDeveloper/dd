          <h3>The game is about guessing the selected character of the day. Each time you make a guess by entering a character name, and then entering the guess. On a guess, squares will then appear on the rows with the different categories. The squares describe what the guessed character's features is. Each square will have a color, each with their own unique meaning. A green square means that your character has the same traits as the character of the day. An orange square means that they share a trait, but they also have a trait that they do not share. A red square means that they do not have anything in common in the given category. Each guess will therefore give you more and more info, until you can deduce what character is the character of the day</h3>

                    <h3 class="question">Which characters are in the game?</h3>
<h3 class="answer">
    All characters who have appeared in the NetherRealm era are included by default. The reason the character pool is limited to modern-era characters is because many of the 3D era fighters are obscure or niche, which could make the game significantly more difficult for players unfamiliar with the Midway era.<br><br>
    However, you can start a new game with 3D era characters in the pool by clicking the 3D Mode button. This will begin a new game that includes those characters.
</h3>

<h3 class="question">What character lore is used?</h3>
<h3 class="answer">
    In Mortal Kombat, a character’s traits and story often change from game to game depending on the current narrative. This means characters may acquire new attributes or roles over time.<br><br>
    To keep things consistent, this game uses the state of each character as they were before the creation of the New Era in Mortal Kombat 11 (2019). For example, Liu Kang is considered both a god and a human, due to the events in Mortal Kombat 11. If a character has had multiple traits due to story progression, they are reflected in this game. For instance, Scorpion starts as a revenant in Mortal Kombat (2011), but by the end of Mortal Kombat X, he is human again — so he is considered both "Human" and "Revenant" in this game.
</h3>

<h3 class="answer">
    Retcons are also treated as canon where applicable. So for example, Sindel is considered "Evil" rather than "Good, Unwillingly Evil".
</h3>

<h3 class="question">What about the characters in Mortal Kombat 1?</h3>
<h3 class="answer">
    3D era characters who only appear in the Mortal Kombat 1 (New Era) timeline are not included in the normal mode character pool.
</h3>

<h3 class="question">I disagree with how a character's canon is established! Is there any way to get it fixed?</h3>
